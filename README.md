# Journey From Colorado to Boone

This project is my first web map created using the Leaflet JavaScript library. It shows the long drive I take from Colorado back to Boone, North Carolina, when returning to campus after my summer internship. The map includes a blue dashed route line across several states and red markers that show each stop made along the way, including gas stops and an overnight break.
